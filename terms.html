        <p>Focus For Good is a productivity application that helps you stay focused by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Blocking distracting apps during focus sessions using Apple's Screen Time API</li>
            <li>Allowing you to commit credits (purchased via in-app purchase) to focus sessions</li>
            <li>Providing motivation through financial commitment</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Operating Modes</h3>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Serious Mode:</strong> You commit credits to your focus session. Complete the session to keep your credits. End early and credits are forfeited.</p>
            <p><strong>Lite Mode:</strong> Free to use. Watch an unskippable advertisement to end your session early.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>3. Credits and Purchases</h2>

        <h3>Purchasing Credits</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Credits are purchased through Apple's In-App Purchase system</li>
            <li>1 Credit = $1 USD</li>
            <li>All purchases are processed by Apple and subject to Apple's terms</li>
            <li>Credits are non-refundable except as required by applicable law</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Using Credits</h3>

            <li>Credits are committed to Serious Mode focus sessions</li>

            <li>End a session early and your committed credits are forfeited</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>No Cash Value</h3>

            <li>Apple's App Store commission (currently 15-30%) is first deducted from the forfeited amount</li>
            <li><strong>75%</strong> of the remaining amount after App Store fees is allocated to your chosen charity</li>
            <li><strong>25%</strong> of the remaining amount after App Store fees supports app development and maintenance</li>
        </ul>
